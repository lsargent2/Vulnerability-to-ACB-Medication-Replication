Replication of ACB study with Psychometrics 
A growing body of research supports the negative impact of anticholinergic drug burden on the peripheral nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggests that the use of any drug with possible or definite anticholinergic properties is associated with an increased risk of falls and a decline in physical function. Prior research has been conducted mainly in epidemiological studies with homogeneous white and/or European populations with inadequate sensitivity testing of the clinical Anticholinergic Burden Tools. This observational cohort study of 80 low-income black and African American older adults confirms the results of anticholinergic burden associated with frailty found in the authorâ€™s previous work. Despite the different properties, the Anticholinergic Burden Tools evaluated were highly correlated and relevant for clinical use. Providers prescribing anticholinergic medications should include considerations for the effects on frail older adults, including diverse populations.
